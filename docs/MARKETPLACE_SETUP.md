   - Plugin name: "HubSpot Form Chooser"
   - SafetyChain and HubSpot logos
   - Visual representation of form selection
   - Clean, professional design

2. **Save it as**: `docs/cover.png`

### Example Cover Image Layout:
```
+----------------------------------+
|     HubSpot Form Chooser         |
|                                  |
|  [SafetyChain Logo] + [HubSpot]  |
|                                  |
|   üîç Search and select forms     |
|   üìù No more copying IDs         |
|   ‚ö° Real-time sync              |
|                                  |
|    For DatoCMS                   |
+----------------------------------+
```

## Creating the Preview GIF/Video

To create a preview showing your plugin in action:

1. **Record a screen capture** showing:
   - Opening the plugin in DatoCMS
   - Searching for a form
   - Selecting a form
   - Showing the selected value
   - (Optional) Configuring the API key

2. **Convert to GIF or MP4**:
   - Keep file size under 10MB
   - 10-30 seconds duration
   - Show the most impressive features

3. **Save as**: `docs/preview.gif` or `docs/preview.mp4`

## Marketplace Metadata

Your plugin already has the basic metadata in `package.json`:

```json
{
  "datoCmsPlugin": {
    "title": "HubSpot Form Chooser",
    "coverImage": "docs/cover.png",
    "previewImage": "docs/preview.gif",
    "entryPoint": "dist/index.html"
  }
}
```

Additional metadata in `datocms.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "HubSpot Form Chooser",
  "description": "Select HubSpot forms by name instead of manually copying form IDs. Features search, caching, and optional archive filtering.",
  "homepage": "https://github.com/SafetyChain/datocms-hubspot-form-chooser-plugin",
